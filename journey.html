        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <p class="journey-text">
            I immersed myself in the world of cryptocurrency in the spring of 2017. The technical side appealed to me the most, as it aligned with my IT background and the fundamental principles of decentralization, which I still consider the most important. My primary focus was cryptocurrency mining. This experience allowed me to develop skills in designing farms from scratch, typically with 30-50 graphics cards—covering everything from space preparation (ventilation/electrics) to procurement, setup, and ensuring 24/7 uptime. Many of my clients still own similar farms today.

As my curiosity grew, I was introduced to DeFi. I learned to manage liquidity and interacted with protocols like Uniswap, Compound, and Aave. I explored various strategies for staking and farming to maximize returns. After a while, I wanted more activity and ventured further.

At the same time, I invested in American stocks at various stages—IPOs, pre-IPOs, and OTC. During this period, I also dabbled in stock market trading, which, thanks to the bull run of 2020-2021, naturally transitioned into crypto trading. This required constant focus and a high tolerance for risk. I realized it was a viable path, but not the one for me. To this day, I apply my own strategies, though they are not financial advice.

When the Play-to-Earn hype took over, with Axie Infinity leading the way, I built and managed a team of seven scholarship squads. This was a valuable experience in organization and diversification.

However, I completely missed out on the IDO wave. My go-to platforms were Raydium AcceleRaytor and Impossible Finance. Fortunately, my common sense told me to stay away from buying tokens at peak hype—those losses would have been brutal. Another financial lesson learned with minimal damage.

The NFT era left me with bags full of “utility” junk spread across dozens of wallets. Some projects hit especially hard—both financially and emotionally. It’s part of the game. When you get attached to a project and genuinely believe in its founder, disappointment is inevitable at times. Despite this, there are still projects I believe in, and I continue to hold them by choice, providing regular support in any way I can.

Retrodrop hunting—open up! No bragging about Arbitrum when the Odyssey launched; I deliberately passed on that one to avoid burning gas. By winter, I knew I needed to protect myself from potential FOMO, but an unexpected health issue derailed those plans—I completely missed Arbitrum (which kicked off the wave of mass retrodrops).

However, I didn’t miss the rise of one of the strongest crypto startups—NFD. I was among the first to join their Discord server, actively participated in Alpha and Beta testing, and created content for the project.

When the Combine software launched, I was one of the first to try it out. At first, I used it purely for personal purposes, maintaining my own farm.

After a while, a community manager position opened up on the NFD team, and I decided to stop being just a taker and start giving back—whether through sharing knowledge or experience.

I now provide technical support to users, helping them get familiar with the product and troubleshoot any issues they encounter while using Combine. My primary support extends to the Telegram and Discord communities. This includes moderation to ensure information security and prevent social engineering, among other responsibilities.

I celebrated with those who were eligible for airdrops from projects like LayerZero, ZKsync, and Scroll, and sympathized with those who were unfairly rejected.

After our team launched NFD Trading Bots, I also joined the technical support team for this sector.

I don’t see my future without Web3, and I’m truly happy to be here, right now, doing something meaningful.
